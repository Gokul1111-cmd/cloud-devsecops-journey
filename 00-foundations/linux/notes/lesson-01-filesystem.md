# Linux Lesson 1 – Filesystem & Navigation

## What `/` Means
Linux has a single filesystem tree starting at root.

## Key Directories
- /home → user data
- /etc → configuration
- /var/log → logs
- /proc → kernel state

## Why `/proc` Is Special
It is a virtual filesystem generated by the kernel.

## Why This Matters in DevOps
Most outages and security issues start from misconfigurations or lack of understanding of these directories.
